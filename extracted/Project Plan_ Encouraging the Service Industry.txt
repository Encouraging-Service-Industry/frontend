Project Plan: Encouraging the Service Industry
1. Project Overview
This project aims to solve a significant social issue by changing people's ingrained perceptions and habits regarding the use of services through an innovative web application. Our target users are busy middle-aged people between 30 and 40 years old. By helping them outsource services, we can reduce their burdens from work and family pressures, thereby improving their quality of life and laying a foundation for their future.
2. Core Problems and Solutions
We focus on three core problems and provide differentiated solutions.
Core Problem
Solution
How can we encourage people to start using services in their daily lives earlier?
"Micro-Habit" Formation Mechanism:
 The 
Value Dashboard
 quantifies saved time and energy (e.g., converting "2 hours" into "one family dinner"). This helps users see the tangible benefits of using services. We also introduce 
"First Task Rewards"
 and 
"Continuous Task Challenges"
 to help users overcome procrastination and form the habit of using services through small, easy steps.
How can we make using services more socially acceptable?
Trust and Social Recognition:
 Our 
"Story Wall"
 and 
"Social Proof"
 features allow users to share and see positive experiences from their peers. This transforms "using services" from a shameful act into a shareable, efficient lifestyle.
How can we make getting services simpler and better understand their value?
Extreme Simplification and Value Visualization:
 We simplify the complex booking process into a 
three-step process
. We also build trust through a 
strict vendor verification system
. The 
"Book for Others"
 feature directly meets the real need to provide services for family members.
3. Market Competition and Differentiation Strategy
Existing platforms, such as TaskRabbit and Freska, are mostly 
"service booking marketplaces"
 that connect users and service providers. Our project is positioned as a 
"Lifestyle Service Habit Formation Platform,"
 and its core competitive advantage lies in the following areas.
Dimension
Existing Platforms (TaskRabbit / Freska, etc.)
Our Project (App v5)
Differentiation Opportunity / Suggestion
Core Positioning
"Service Booking Marketplace":
 Quickly find people to perform tasks like cleaning, maintenance, and errands.
"Lifestyle Service Habit Formation Platform":
 Not just finding services but also changing users' perceptions and habits.
Your positioning is more long-term and psychological. It needs to strengthen "habit formation" and "identity recognition" instead of just being a marketplace.
Value Presentation
Time/labor saved (implicit, felt by the user).
Value Dashboard:
 Visually displays time saved plus emotional value (e.g., converted into "family dinner" or "bedtime story").
This is a strong differentiator. It can be expanded into a "life coaching" function to provide personalized diagnostics and recommendations.
Social Recognition
Almost none, just a simple rating system.
Story Wall, Peer Data
 (80% of families use鈥?, 
Recommendation Sharing
.
This is a major innovation. 
鈿狅笍 Cold start risk, requires initial seed users or partner companies to import content.
Trust Mechanism
Ratings + partial background checks. Insurance is rare.
Background checks, qualification certification, satisfaction guarantee, real-time location tracking.
The trust mechanism is stronger. 
鈿狅笍 High cost, need to balance verification depth with scalability.
Family / Multi-generational Scenarios
Single user orders for themselves.
Family account, Order for others
 (parents, partners, children).
This is a gap in the Nordic market. It can be further developed into "cross-generational task relay" to make services a family bond.
Incentives / Loyalty
Low prices, discounts, subscription models. Points / rewards / achievement systems.
We suggest upgrading to 
"Identity Badges"
 and 
"Lifestyle Levels"
 to strengthen social showcasing.
Not much different from the market; this is a new, upgraded strategy.
Channels / Touchpoints
Standalone App; users actively download and use.
Mobile-first, with future expansion to 
corporate benefits/family packages
.
Opportunity: Can be bundled with employer benefits or government subsidies to lower psychological and economic barriers.
Community / Mutual Aid
Basically none, purely commercial relationships.
Neighborhood Mutual Aid / Time Bank model
.
Differentiation opportunity: Can integrate neighborhood mutual aid, allowing users to switch between "commercial outsourcing" and "community mutual aid".
AI / Personalized Recommendations
Limited, mainly relying on search filters.
Future plan: 
Smart matching / demand forecasting
.
Can pre-design 
"behavioral insights + social proof recommendations,"
 for example, "You spent 10 hours on gardening last month; 70% of your neighbors used service provider A".
4. Project Risks and Countermeasures
Risk Point
Countermeasure
The initial version is too complex.
Adhere to the 
MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
 principle. The initial version will only implement P0 priority features (e.g., registration, basic booking, and trust verification). P1 and P2 features will be iterated gradually in subsequent versions.
"Story Wall"
 cold start failure.
In the initial stage, we will cooperate with community partners (e.g., apartment management companies, family service organizations) to import seed users and initial content to ensure the 
"Story Wall"
 is not empty.
Insufficient appeal of the incentive mechanism.
We will not only rely on traditional points but will also upgrade the incentive mechanism to 
"Identity Badges"
 and 
"Lifestyle Levels,"
 allowing users to gain 
social recognition
 through sharing, thus driving long-term use.
High compliance and trust costs.
We will prioritize testing in small-scale markets and cooperate with existing third-party background check service providers to control costs and simplify processes.
5. Next Steps
Technical Design:
 Complete API specification documents and database design to guide front-end and back-end teams for parallel development.
Development Implementation:
 Prioritize developing P0 features and build a functional MVP version, including user registration, service search, and a simplified booking process.
User Testing:
 Continuously conduct small-scale user tests during development to collect feedback and iterate quickly.
